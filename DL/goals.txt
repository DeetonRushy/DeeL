DL config language.

On the same page as Json, Ini, .cfg etc...(in terms of functionality)
Below are syntax goals, followed by their semantics.

1. No top level Braces `{ ...data }`, always seems pointless.

`
"information" = {
    "version": 1.9
}
`

instead of 
`
{
    "information": {
        "version": 1.9
    }
}
`

Top level braces make sense in JSON, due to the fact it is a js object. To be initialized (in js),
it needs to be `= {...}`. But for something only focused on configuration, this is pointless.

2. Builtin variables, for identification purposes.

Names
`
 # name of config
"dl_name": "My Config"
 # version of config
"dl_version": "1.9.2"
 # language bindings this is meant for
"dl_lang": "csharp"
`

Having these presets always present (defaulted if not defined) is useful.
It prevents things like:
`if (!_config.HasElement("config_name")) ... else thing=_config["config_name"]`
and replaces it with
`thing = _config.Name`

3. Point 2 flows into point 3.
